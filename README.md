# Calculator
A simple calculator app which can be viewed at  
âž¤ https://m1nhnho.github.io/calculator/

Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The user can also use their keyboard to interact with the calculator.

## Assumptions
The user should expect similar functionality to Window's calculator app:
- The `C` button meaning to clear display
- The `*` key corresponds to multiplication
- The `/` key corresponds to division 

## Limitations
- No brackets
- Only supports basic operators
- Lacking `CE` button to clear current number
